Data were then calibrated using various scripts that utilized mutiple linear regressions techniques fitted against a reference instrument 

Analyses of calibration performance were then conducted utilizing metrics such as r-squared, slope, RMSE, etc.

Purpose of these results was to develop techniques and procedures for low cost air quality sensor calibration and performance
